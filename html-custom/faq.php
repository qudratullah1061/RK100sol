In this case, if you really appreciate there dedication, you could pamper them once a month if you wish.  Usually 10-15% is recommended.</p>

                        <p>Tour guides are hired for the day and offer walking tours or may taxi you around.  They usually live in or close to your destination.  Good communication, planning and sharing personal interest is key to making the most of your day.</p>
                        <p>A travel companion is an individual who will assist you from the very start of your travels.  This service is a real asset for people who want personal security during the vacation.  Assistance for people with limited disabilities find a social companion very helpful.  We suggest both client and social companion meet prior to any travel destination to test compatibility and discuss travel plans.</p>

                        <p>Communication is key when hiring for any occasion.  If you are hiring for an office party or wedding for example, these details need to be share with the social companion prior to agreeing on the contract: date, number of hours, city, venue, dress code and the type of music.  If the social companion accepts the contract then you can assume they will be dressed for that specific occasion.  But never assume this.</p>
