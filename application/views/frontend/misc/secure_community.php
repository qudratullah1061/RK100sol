        <p>What if we told you that you could be a part of a marketplace that fulfills your every need? You could hire a chef, find travel companions, even walking partners within minutes?</p>
        <p>With Konsorts, we are shaping the way people do business. Gone are the days where it took hours of research and referrals to find what you were looking for. Konsorts is a consolidated platform that provides you with anything you need, at any given time.  </p>
        <p>To ensure authenticity, every individual on this website has been verified so that there are no scams. Each member is asked to upload identification to verify whether they are really who they say they are. For us, safety comes first and we have created a <b><a>secure market</a></b> of supply and demand for every legal service required. </p>
        <p>However, with every business there is always an element of caution.  For certain categories, we advise  our users to meet for the first time in a public environment so that both parties can evaluate one another. This holds true for all types of services; whether you are looking for an event planner, looking to hire a chef or join a gym, it is advisable to check the credentials and then take the leap. </p>
        <p>Once you have established that you wish to pursue this service with Konsorts, exchange telephone numbers so that you can establish a direct contact. We, at Konsorts, are here to resolve conflicts if they arise. That way your travel companions, walking partners or even companions who accompany you to the movies are verified and liable to be evaluated per their assignment. </p>
        <p>The best part is the two way feedback. While the client evaluates the service provider, the service provider also evaluates the client. This way we ensure that the feedback is honest and each provide the best possible service. In order to avoid bad feedback, the best thing to do is to ask questions beforehand. Service providers should fully comprehend what the client wants and the client should understand the service provider’s capabilities. Each job comes with its specific roles and responsibilities and hence both parties should be in the know. </p>
        <p>Not only can you find walking partners or find travel companions, you can also sign up as one. Maybe you are a small time business looking to expand your reach or maybe you are shifting gears and want a platform to make an quick buck. Konsorts is a great breeding ground for talent. If you are good at what you do, you will gain clients, great feedback and if you are lucky, lasting friendships. </p>
        <p>You can also customize your packages. Maybe you are planning a party, but you don’t want an event planner, just somebody who’s responsible for the food. After all, that’s the part that everyone remembers! In such a case you could simply hire a chef to facilitate your guests and take care of the menu while hiring a separate event planner. </p>
        <p>Or maybe you are looking to travel to an unknown place, and you want to try different traveling techniques. For the duration of your visit you could find travel companions and find walking partners depending on your activities. While a travel companion can take you to places unknown, you could find walking partners so that two people can find solace in the beauty of the world, without the aspect of travel guidance. </p>
        <p>Konsorts makes all your decisions customizable and executable. So do what you have to. Hire a chef, find travel companions, find walking partners, find someone to catch a movie with- maybe even find someone to go to a book launch with. </p>
        <p>With Konsorts anything is possible.</p>
