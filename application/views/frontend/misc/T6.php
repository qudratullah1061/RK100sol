                        <p>Do you have an extra room or two in your house or apartment? Then you are perfectly eligible to start your own homestay hosting business, which is a great way to earn extra money.</p>
                        <p>Really, that is the only prerequisite, as anyone can start this simple business that can make you money while you make friends all over the world. Sounds interesting? Are you ready to become a host for travellers? Here’s how you can do it.</p>



                        <h2 class="text-purple font-weight-700 text-normal line-height-normal margin-10px-top margin-10px-bottom">The How</h2>
                        <p>Running a successful homestay is like running any other successful business.</p>
                        <p>It can be broken down into small, manageable steps that act as guideline you can follow to set it up correctly.</p>
                        <p>You have to follow a few guidelines to ensure you will present your home and yourself in a positive light to potential guests.</p>
                        <p>There are three steps towards a profitable homestay business:</p>

                        <ul class="list-style-custom margin-10px-top margin-10px-bottom font-weight-700 text-extra-dark-gray">
                            <li>Step #1: Preparing your homestay</li>
                            <li>Step #2: Marketing your homestay</li>
                            <li>Step #3: Making your guests happy</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>Let’s take a look at each.</p>

                        <h2 class="text-purple font-weight-700 text-normal line-height-normal margin-10px-top margin-10px-bottom">Step One: Preparing your homestay</h2>
                        <p>When you are preparing your homestay, it is a good time to first think about the kind of people you want to host.</p>
                        <p>Would you rather host young hippies or classy older couples? Both demographics have different needs, and pleasing everyone at the same time isn’t possible.</p>
                        <p>Take a look at what you’re working with (your house, apartment, rooms) and think about who would most like to stay here. If you figure this out now, you’ll have an easier time figuring out how to present yourself in the right way to the right guests.</p>

                        <h2 class="text-purple font-weight-700 text-normal line-height-normal margin-10px-top margin-10px-bottom">Furnishing your homestay</h2>
                        <p>While many homestays decide to go for a certain theme and pick furniture to go along with it, it isn’t a necessity.</p>
                        <p>If you have the resources to refurbish a room in a certain style, or do a few tweaks to improve what you already have, do go ahead! It certainly is a selling point and can attract more customers.</p>
                        <p>However, many homestay owners focus on things like this and forget about the very basics.</p>
                        <p>There are a few guidelines that can take a mediocre place and turn it into a great experience for your guests.</p>
                        <ol class="list-style-1 padding-15px-left margin-0">
                            <li>
                                <h2 class="text-purple font-weight-700 text-normal line-height-normal margin-10px-top margin-10px-bottom">Cleanliness</h2>
                                <p>If your rooms are impeccably clean, most your guests won’t even notice. But you can be sure that they will notice every bit of dirt and dust (and might mention it in a review).</p>
                                <p>So make sure that the floor is hoovered, that the shelves are dusted and that the bins are empty - especially when they first arrive. You can’t improve a bad first impression. </p>
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                <h2 class="text-purple font-weight-700 text-normal line-height-normal margin-10px-top margin-10px-bottom">Amenities</h2>

                                <p>Will you include a breakfast for your guests? Do you have a hot tub installed? Will you also host pets?</p>
                                <p>Make a list of amenities (we’ll need it later when writing the listing).</p>
                                <p>At the top of the list is a Wi-Fi connection. If you don’t have one (or if it’s a slow one), you sales may reflect that - especially if you want to attract young people.</p>
                                <p>In general, try to offer anything a good hotel would. That means fresh towels, shampoo and other personal hygiene products. Guest will appreciate it.</p>

                            </li>
                            <li>
                                <h2 class="text-purple font-weight-700 text-normal line-height-normal margin-10px-top margin-10px-bottom">Decoration</h2>
                                <p>You don’t need to go overboard with decorations - a small piece of art can go a long way to liven up a room.</p>
                                <p>Pick something that goes with the existing style of your place, something that will appeal to your target demographic.</p>
                            </li>
                        </ol>


                        <div class="section-seperator"></div>



                        <h2 class="text-purple font-weight-700 text-normal line-height-normal margin-10px-top margin-10px-bottom">Step Two: Marketing your homestay</h2>
                        <p>This is where you choice of demographic comes into play.</p>
                        <p>You know what kind of guests you want to host and you can gear your profile towards them, which will make them more likely to stay with you.</p>
                        <p>(If you don’t yet have a picked demographic or you would just like a nice mix of people to come stay with you, feel free to have a more general profile - but still follow the basics!)</p>
                        <ol class="list-style-1 padding-15px-left margin-0">
                            <li>
                                <h2 class="text-purple font-weight-700 text-normal line-height-normal margin-10px-top margin-10px-bottom">Take excellent photos</h2>
                                <p>Taking great photos is a skill you definitely need to present your home in the best possible way.</p>
                                <p>Luckily you might not even need to hire a photographer or buy a professional camera. Most modern smartphones have cameras that can do a great job at taking photos.</p>
                                <p>A good photo is more about the photographer than it is about the camera.</p>
                                <p>Take a few pictures of every room of your place, as well as the outside area, if any. That means the living room, kitchen, bathroom,... Take multiple of each: you can pick the best ones later.</p>
                                <p>Follow these tips to get great smartphone photos:</p>
                                <ul class="list-style-3 margin-15px-tb">
                                    <li class="margin-0">Try to take them in sunny weather, they’ll look better</li>
                                    <li class="margin-0">Hold your phone horizontally</li>
                                    <li class="margin-0">Try to place the phone on a stable surface to minimize blur</li>
                                </ul>

                                <p>If you know how to use Photoshop, you can touch the photos up on your own, or just use an app like Instagram to add a bit of flair to the photos - but beware, don’t go overboard! An over-the-top filter might come across as if you’re trying to hide something. Go for bright, lively photos.</p>
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                <h2 class="text-purple font-weight-700 text-normal line-height-normal margin-10px-top margin-10px-bottom">Write a compelling description</h2>

                                <p>This is where you take out the list of amenities you’ve written before and showcase your homestay in the best way possible.</p>
                                <p>Make sure to include all the details about your place: the amenities, the services you offer (airport pickup, doing laundry, cooking meals, spending time with the guests,...). </p>
                                <p>Also, if there’s something that’s a dealbreaker for you in a guest (you don’t like smoking, are allergic to cats, etc.), make sure to write it down too. It’s better to lose a guest than to have to endure something you don’t want to.</p>
                                <p>Besides writing about the place your guests will be staying at, also write about yourself! After all, you are half of the “attraction”. </p>
                                <p>Tell them a bit about yourself, mention hobbies, which languages you speak (a bonus if you host international travellers) and give them an idea of what they can expect. They’re going to be staying with you, so give them a reason why they should care. </p>
                                <p>The main thing you can get in a homestay that you can’t get in a hotel is a personal relationship with a local who can help you get around - if you can reflect that in your profile, you’re good to go.</p>
                                <p>Remember, your profile is a preview of what staying with you will be like. Make sure that it’s true to that and that you don’t promise anything you can’t deliver.</p>

                            </li>
                            <li>
                                <h2 class="text-purple font-weight-700 text-normal line-height-normal margin-10px-top margin-10px-bottom">Decide on the price</h2>
                                <p>The price you decide to set for your homestay is entirely in your hands, but it also has to be appropriate.</p>
                                <p>The more you can offer, the more you can ask for - any additional things that you can provide increase your value, and therefore your price.</p>
                                <p>In order to not price yourself out, take a look at how much others are charging, and in doubt, go a bit lower - you can always increase your prices later. </p>
                            </li>
                        </ol>

                        <h2 class="text-purple font-weight-700 text-normal line-height-normal margin-10px-top margin-10px-bottom">Step Three: Making your guests happy</h2>

                        <p>Ultimately, the homestay experience is all about being welcome like a family member visiting from out of town.</p>
                        <p>What kind of things would you do for a member of your family? How would you treat them? </p>
                        <p>Make that the basis of how you treat your guests.</p>
                        <p>This isn’t a science, but much more of an art that you will master with time. But there are two keys that will help you: flexibility and pleasantness.</p>
                        <p>Being flexible is necessary because you will meet people who won’t be exactly like you and since they’re staying with you, both sides will have to show a little bit of flexibility.</p>
                        <p>Of course, this doesn’t mean that certain things like basic house rules (which you set) go out the window, but different personalities mash together in various ways.</p>
                        <p>I always like to imagine it like seeing a relative who came out of town and you haven’t seen for years. At first, it might be a bit awkward, the conversation might not flow, but as long as you stay pleasant, they will open up.</p>
