        <p>This site was created for a few good reasons: to provide quality professionals and companions who wish to represent themselves without the use of an agent, to work in a well needed industry that offers platonic services and provide the security that all members deserve when contracting through a web site.</p>
        <p>We encourage individuals who wish to enrich the lives of others, through ethical and quality services world wide. </p>
        <p>We pride ourselves on creating a safer world by screening both the guest and the companion, we have a verification system in place to protect the well being of all members. Each member must show proof of their identity to join. This process alleviates people who have bad intentions from joining this community </p>
        <p>Konsotrs.com was created by <span class="font-weight-700">Richard Konicki</span> a Canadian.  Richard has travelled to over 20 countries and is a dad and grand dad. Having 30 years experience in education as an event planner, coach and a mentor to students. He also managed an international English Second Language school for 17 years. He is also a successful business owner in a private practice. </p>
        <p>Richard knows that this business will serve and enrich the lives of others world wide and is badly needed in our society today. “There is an aging population who wish to travel but require the security to do so.” He also stated “that studies show a paradigm shift of more and more, single professionals who want non committal relationships, non sexual companionship and for all sort of occasions.” He realizes that the potential is even greater today and brighter tomorrow. Bringing out the best skills and qualities in people is key and to offer quality services on a website that is simple to use.  “Security of all members on Konsorts is also a key priority, eliminating fake profiles and deterring scammers is the ultimate win-win situation for all concerned,” says Richard Konicki. </p>
        <p>Richard wished that a service like this existed for his late mother, saying, “A companion to read and sing with my mother would had given her such joy.” </p>
