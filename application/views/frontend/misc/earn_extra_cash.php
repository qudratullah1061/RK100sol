        <p>Unlike many other earning websites, Konsorts helps you make money online without needing any prior experience in most cases. You get the opportunity to earn extra money on top of your daily wages. </p>
        <p>This is especially useful for people who are looking to break out of their daily grind and change career paths. Instead of dropping everything at the drop of a hat to pursue a path that you have no knowledge about (which can be daunting), you get the chance to dip your toes and see what it’s like to pursue a different direction. </p>
        <p>What can be scary is the range of things you can do. You can be a historian who is a part time local travel guide or you can be a student looking to earn extra money by accompanying someone to a movie – Konsorts has an opportunity for everybody. And it doesn’t stop there. </p>
        <p>You don’t even have to limit yourself to one or the other. You could be a local travel guide and a gym buddy AND an event planner all in one. Not only is it an easy way to make money online, it is also a way to enhance your skill set. Many people want to find time to do things they enjoy but more often than not they lack the motivation to do it. Very few have the ability to do things we enjoy, just because. The benefit of earning extra money can be a great motivating factor – whether we acknowledge it or not. </p>
        <p>Konsorts provides a hassle free way of becoming employed. All you have to do is sign up, make a profile and respond to guest members from your local area. You get ratings based on your performance. Tips, experience, past projects can all be mentioned on your profile so that the client has a complete picture of who they are hiring. After all, while you are finding ways to make money online, they are also spending online so they need to make an informed decision. </p>
        <p>While those without qualifications need not despair, those who do have diplomas and certifications can always add that on their profile for extra edge. All in all, Konsorts is a great platform for those who want to earn extra money as well as those who are looking for a one window solution to all their needs. </p>
        <p>But sometimes it’s not even about the money. It’s also about serving people and companionships. What makes work fun and worth doing is human interaction. Even while we slave away on our computers, it is often nice to know that there is an audience that is reading it – human interaction in any shape or form is always welcome. Konsorts is a way to get off your computer, meet people and develop relationships while you still make money online. It’s a great way to leverage online relationships to develop long lasting offline ones. You will meet people you love, some you like a lot and some who are just not your cup of tea, but with every interaction you will learn something about yourself as well as about the other person. So while you earn extra money (which doesn’t hurt), you find yourself and you find meaning in relationships – there’s a lot more to gain here than there is to lose. </p>
        <p>Use Konsorts to build your credibility online, build on your skills, garner long term relationships and earn extra money. Use your brain power and your willpower to find extra time in the day to put on multiple hats. Be a local travel guide, be an entertainer, be a companion – and through it all learn to be you. </p>
        <p>How wonderful is that?</p>
