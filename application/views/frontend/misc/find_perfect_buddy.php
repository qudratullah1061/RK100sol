        <p>Do you wish you could find a buddy to keep you company during your favorite activities? Or are you an active fitness enthusiasts who would like to make some extra money doing what you love?</p>

        <p>Find your perfect fitness partner with us!</p>

        <p>Konsorts.com is a simple, safe and fun way to meet new fitness buddies who will provide you with pleasant company and motivation when you need it the most.</p>

        <p>We are a platonic-only online platform where you can find walking partners, fellow gym enthusiasts, mountain hikers and other people doing countless fun fitness activities.</p>

        <p>And not only that: you can make extra money while doing just that.</p>

        <p>Here’s how it works:</p>

        <h6 class="text-extra-dark-gray text-medium alt-font font-weight-500 margin-15px-top margin-20px-bottom text-purple">I’m looking for a fitness partner</h6>

        <p>If you’re looking for someone to do your favorite activity with, you can search for buddies who are offering the service you’re interested in.</p>

        <p>You become a guest member and gain access to our worldwide database, full of interesting new people to meet. When one of them piques your interest, you can message them and start a chat!</p>

        <p>Don’t be afraid to ask them questions - that is how you can build a great relationship with your buddy.</p>

        <p>On our platform, you won’t ever have to worry about spam or unwanted messages; only buddies who you message first will be able to message you back.</p>

        <p>We know that one of the biggest concerns about meeting people online is safety - and we’ve taken yours very seriously.</p>

        <p>That is why all members have to pass strict background checks before they’re allowed to join our community, and, to show that they are serious, also pay a fee.</p>

        <p>You too will have to provide an ID and pay a small yearly fee, but we’re sure that the new friends you will make will make up for it many times over.</p>

        <p>That way, we can ensure the safety of everyone involved, and safety is our number one priority.</p>

        <p>Once you have exchanged a few messages with your new buddy, you can meet - we recommend meeting over a cup of coffee first. That way, the two of you can see if you click with each other. If you do, great - off to new adventures you go!</p>

        <p>But don’t worry if you don’t: there’s someone for everyone in our community and we’ll work hard to find a perfect match for you.</p>

        <h6 class="text-extra-dark-gray text-medium alt-font font-weight-500 margin-15px-top margin-20px-bottom text-purple">I want to be a fitness partner</h6>

        <p>If you’re looking to make extra money, sign up to be a buddy and become a part of our community!</p>

        <p>You’ll be able to earn a supplementary income doing something you’d be doing anyway - and you’ll be able to make new friends at the same time.</p>

        <p>To get access to our database, you will have to pay a 6 or a 12 month fee. However, don’t worry if the fee is too high for you at the moment: we offer a one month free trial so you can get started right away.</p>

        <p>After a background check for safety purposes, you will be able to choose which activities you’d enjoy doing and any special skills you might have (such as first aid, working with people with disabilities or anything else that will make you stand out to potential clients).</p>

        <p>Then, you’ll create a profile - and you will be able to start making money.</p>

        <p>Since we don’t allow service providers to message members looking to hire, your profile will do the selling for you. Make sure it’s fun, lighthearted and interesting and you will get more interested clients.</p>

        <p>Great experiences will lead to more clients and extended relationships - we’re sure that both of you will have the time of your lives!</p>
